In this chapter, we will show you step by step how you can easily calculate the rule of three and explain the terms proportional and antiproportional rule of three. At the end of the article, you can directly apply and test your knowledge with our practice exercises ðŸ™‚

Let's go!

## What is the rule of three?

The rule of three is a method in mathematics with which you can calculate an unknown quantity from the ratio between two known quantities. The basic requirement for the rule of three is the mastery of multiplication and division.

With the help of the rule of three, tasks in real life can be simplified. Among other things, prices in the supermarket or quantities in cooking and baking can be determined.

In these calculators you have the possibility to calculate the rule of three.

The rule of three is divided into proportional and antiproportional rule of three.

## Proportional rule of three

===calcRuleOfThree===

An imaginable text problem for the Proportional Rule of Three would be:

===calcRuleOfThreeText===

Imagine you want to buy three packages of cookies. One package of cookies costs â‚¬0.75. Then two packs of cookies cost twice as much (â‚¬1.50) and three packs of cookies cost three times as much (â‚¬2.25). This is a proportional relationship.

First, let's illustrate the math using a table.

The task in a math assignment could read:

"You are standing at the cheese counter in the supermarket and want to buy 3 kilograms of Gouda. 5 kilograms of Gouda cost 25.50 euros. How much does 3 kilograms cost?"

The solution path is actually quite simple:

<div class="box-info">

Step 1: Data collection
â†’ 5 kg of cheese costs â‚¬25.50
Step 2: Calculate price for 1 kg
â†’ 1 kg of cheese costs 25.50 : 5 = 5.10â‚¬.
Step 3: Calculate price for 3 kg
â†’ 3 kg of cheese cost 5,10 - 3 = 15,30

</div>

## Calculate antiproportional rule of three.

===calcRuleOfThreeAP===

In this case, too, you can illustrate the calculation path very well with a table. But first, let's look at an example problem.

"Three employees of the tax office need 32 hours to finish the accounting of an important customer. How many hours in total are needed if eight employees work on the billing?"

Again, the calculation path consists of 3 steps:

<div class="box-info">

1. data collection
â†’ 3 employees need 32 working hours
2. calculate hours for one employee
â†’ 1 employee alone requires 32 hours - 3 = 96 working hours
3. calculate hours for 8 employees
â†’ 8 employees need 96 hours : 8 = 12 working hours.
Quite simple really, isn't it? The most important step is to realize that this is an antiproportional allocation, because the more employees working on the same project, the less time is needed in total.

## Learn to calculate the rule of three
Here's what you should keep in mind when doing rule of three calculations:

<div class="box-info">

1. look at the assignment: often the assignment already gives important information about how you should use the rule of three. Think carefully about what kind of rule of three (proportional or antiproportional) has to be calculated.
2. data collection: write down which values you already have and which target value should be calculated.
3. table as an aid: tables are a great aid to better understand the calculation paths. It is therefore worthwhile to create a table for your values and to record the individual steps.

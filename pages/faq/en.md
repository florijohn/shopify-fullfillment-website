    - name: How does MachMaMathe work?
      answer: MachMaMathe is an automated service that enables anyone to solve all sorts of common arithmetic problems in a matter of seconds by accessing the Internet.
    - name: How do I use matrix solutions?
      answer: Any time you do a calculation in MachMaMathe that creates a matrix solution. The input form is already in the correct format required for Matrix access to MachMaMathe, so if you want to reuse that result in another calculation, just copy and paste it where needed.
    - name: How do I multiply fractions?
      answer: Before you enter a product of two fractions, make sure you know how to enter fractions correctly. Whenever you are multiplying two fractions by each other (or actually a fraction by something else) make sure you have bound each fraction to a set of brackets.

## How does MachMaMathe work?
MachMaMathe is an automated service that enables anyone to solve all sorts of common arithmetic problems in a matter of seconds by accessing the Internet.

## How do I use matrix solutions?
Any time you do a calculation in MachMaMathe that creates a matrix solution. The input form is already in the correct format required for Matrix access to MachMaMathe, so if you want to reuse that result in another calculation, just copy and paste it where needed.

## How do I enter matrices?
The matrix must enter one row at a time. Each row should start with a new line, and the elements in each row need to be separated by commas. Always make sure you have the same number of elements in each row, otherwise MachMaMathe will return an error.

As an example, the matrix:

123
456
789
Notice that each row starts with a new line and the three items in each row are separated by commas. In MachMaMathe the matrix can be as complex as yours. As in the example above, they can only contain numbers, or they can add complex mathematical expressions using numbers and functions.
When you enter the matrix, you don't have to align rows and columns - as long as each row is on a new line and the elements are separated by commas, MachMaMathe will know what you mean.

## How do I multiply fractions?
Before you enter a product of two fractions, make sure you know how to enter fractions correctly. Whenever you are multiplying two fractions by each other (or actually a fraction by something else) make sure you have bound each fraction to a set of brackets.

## How do I enter fractions?
One of the biggest problems with using MachMaMathe knows how to enter fractions correctly. This section will explain exactly how to write fractions so that MachMaMathe can interpret them correctly.

## What is an equation?
An equation consists of two expressions, each side of an equal symbol (=). Whenever you use a command from the Equations section you need to enter an equation. These categories require only one expression.

## I sent my question. But I got a timeout message.
Each MachMaMathe query is allocated a specific second of device time. Thatâ€™s plenty for most calculations, but sometimes your time will run out before answering questions. When this happens, you will receive a deadline message. If possible, try to resubmit your question in small chunks.

## Can I link to a calculator from my website at MachMaMathe.com?
